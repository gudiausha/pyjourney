# Website - Minutes

### Day 1:
  - Designed the homepage & about page of the website
  - Created the core outline of the website
  - #### Lessons learnt:
    - Not to waste time on html/css/bootstrap, main focus is flask framework
    - css doesn't accept the `{{url_for()}}`, the initial syntax `background image: url()` was correct
    - #### clear the cache regularly and rerun the app.py file each time when making changes, sometimes the changes may or maynot get reflected.

### Day 2:
  - Finalized the html/css view of the website
  - Designed the UI portion of the website(not gonna change this time)
  - re-arranged the folder structure 
  - decided to have a secret login page for myself so I can easily update,delete,add and remove the blogposts
  - #### To Do:
    - must create a user's model for login 
    - blogpost model for CRUD ops 
    - blogpost templates(with and without images, so I can easily upload my posts)
