Out of the curiosity and the urge to know why people are behind this so called  <b>ML</b>,
I had decided to give Machine Learning a try. I have been following <b>Jose Portilla's Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp</b>.
I really liked the way the instructor has explained the concepts, though not in depth but i feel its good for someone who is a beginner in ML.
And so here is my ML repo(which acts more as an personal ML daily journal) for begineers like me to refer to and for amteaurs and experts
to provide some insights.
