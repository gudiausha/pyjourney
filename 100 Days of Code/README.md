Hello, I have decided to take up the 100 days of code challenge. I have certain topics in mind which I would like to master, if not master
atleast be at intermediate level. And I have tried to take up many study plans but nothing seems to work out, I feel I keep going back to 
where I started. 

I am by no means a python expert. While I might be considered a python intermediate I don't feel like one. But I'm also not starting 
from square one either. So I have decided to take up the 100 days challenge, where I shall dedicate few hours everyday to learn and 
code some projects. And I have also decided to add a minutes diary of sorts where I shall log in each day's effort. 
The plan is curated according to the "100DaysofCode in Python" from TalkPython where a topic is introduced and it is covered over a 
course of 3 days. I wish to cover python fundamentals(not to spend much time on it...just refreshing the basics), data structure and algo 
using python, python frameworks(django) and ML if all goes well.The contents for the 100 days are taken from various sources such as 
Ruestone Academy, TalkPython for now. And for ML ideas would be from Avik Jain repo. Links have been provided below.
